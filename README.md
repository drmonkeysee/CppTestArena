#CppTestArena

Like its partner, CTestArena, this is a toy C++ project with which to refresh my memory of how to use the C++ language.

This won't be a real project. It won't compile into something cool. It's just a sounding board to explore various aspects of C++ which I haven't touched since college oh so very long ago. Though the long term goal **is** to build something cool with C++.
